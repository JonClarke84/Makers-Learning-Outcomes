Final Notes:
I had done some of this process on some personal projects in the weeks leading up to starting with Makers. However, I'd only interfaced with Git and GitHub through the desktop app and VS Code.

I had also completed the introduction to Git pre-course material that was sent out by email.

Using the CLI in this exercises has given me a much better understanding of the process - especially when creating files using the terminal.

Learning Outcomes 1:
Manually set up a computer for web development
Install XCode
Install Homebrew
Install RVM and Ruby
Install Pry

Learning Outcomes 2:
Command Line
The most important things that you come away with from this part of the course are:

No (or reduced) fear of the command line
An understanding that the command line allows direct access to a computer's underlying code
Use of these three commands: ls, pwd, and cd
Now take a moment to reflect on the other things that we've covered, so far. You don't need to feel comfortable with them before moving on â€“ you'll get plenty of practice as and when they become useful to you.

Creating, moving and copying files
Creating and removing directories
Using the manual command
Super user

Learning Outcomes 3:
Git
Recall that git is a version control system (VCS)
Recognise common git commands, such as fetch, init, clone, pull, push, add, remote, and commit
Explain the following terms: 'staging', 'upstream', 'remote'
Clone a git repo
Add files for staging in a git repo
Commit staged files in a git repo
Push files to a remote repo
Fork a git repo
