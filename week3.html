                  <h2>Monday</h2>

                  <p>On to a new topic today - the golden square (with a major focus on pairing). I found the pairing session to be productive,
                    if tiring to do for such a prolonged period.

    <p>Made good progress on the challenges today, along with a good (if shorter) pairing session in the afternoon.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>

        <p>More good progress, including finding a challenge solution that had eluded me at the end of Tuesday.
          Another good pairing session today too, longer but productive.
          We got the second debugging challenge completed and the first challenge done on Test Driving a Class System.</p>
