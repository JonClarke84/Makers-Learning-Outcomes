                  <h2>End of unit reflection.</h2>

                  <p>I enjoyed making something with an interface and making something that I could imagine a real person using.</p>
                    
                  <p>I'd never made anything with the MVC model before, so this was something to get my head around.
                    The solo Friday task has helped cement a few concepts for me - such as using a controller to decide which page to view next.
                    Previous to this I had only done light JS with anything front end.</p>

        <h2>Regarding the unit's overall goals</h2>
        <div class="grid-item-content">
    <p> I feel confident that I could go on to write my own web apps with Ruby in this framework. I'd need to heavily refer to previous work at the moment though.</p>

    <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Regarding your personal objectives, if you set any</h2>

        <p>Objectives: I just wanted to absorb as much as possible and to be able to add my own features beyond the minimum.</p>
    
        <h3>List of what has been done</h3>
        <p>I didn't encounter any issues with this, fortunately.</p>

        <h2>Your BUD entry</h2>

        <p>This has been a good week, I've really enjoyed the challenge task.
          My pairs and peer group have been checking in during the afternoons
          for the most part, so I've only had one dedicated long pairing session,
          which was excellent by the way.</p>

          <p>I feel ready to continue and I'm looking forward to the projects and being able to write a full piece of software.</p>
