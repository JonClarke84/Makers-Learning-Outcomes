          <div class="grid-item-content">
                  <p> I enjoyed seeing the project come together on the third and fourth day most of all,
                    once we had finished the MVP and started moving on to adding extra features.</p>

                  <p>I liked solving problems with team members and working together to find the best solutions.
                    Often this would involve doing things that I would not have thought to do, so I felt
                    like I got good value out of the pairing.</p>

        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <div class="grid-item-content">
    <p>I didn't learn much extra programming on this module as that clearly wasn't the focus.
      I've also worked as a lead on an agile team for several years and so didn't feel like
      I learned too much in that regard either.</p>
    
    <p>The most useful thing for this week was working in a team with Git - merges etc</p>

    <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Regarding the unit's overall goals</h2>
    <div class="grid-item-content">
        <p> I already felt very confident working in a team in this format
          as I've already been doing it for several years in my previous role.
          Teamwork on git was more straightforward than I anticipated.</p>

    <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>And in addition</h2>

        <p>I think I/we should have put in place a better structure with regard to sharing
          out responsibilities in our team. Due to my history working with agile it fell
          on me to run all our planning and retros and the mental load of running our team
          ended up on me.</p>

        <p>I wanted and expected other team members to step up to volunteer, and although 2-3 really helped out we had a couple who sat back passively.</p>  
    
    </div>

    <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>In addition</h2>
        <p>I think that without a forced regime change every day it became easier for my team to just rely
          on a couple of us to run everything and I don't think that was fair on us that took the initiative.</p>
