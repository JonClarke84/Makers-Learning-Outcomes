        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <div class="grid-item-content">
    <p>I had done some of this process on some personal projects in the weeks leading up to starting with Makers. However, I'd only interfaced with Git and GitHub through the desktop app and VS Code.
    
    I had also completed the introduction to Git pre-course material that was sent out by email.
    
    Using the CLI in this exercises has given me a much better understanding of the process - especially when creating files using the terminal.</p>
    
    <h3>Environment set up</h3>
    <p>I didn't encounter any issues with this, fortunately.</p>
    <ul><li>Manually set up a computer for web development</li>
    <li>Install XCode</li>
    <li>Install Homebrew</li>
    <li>Install RVM and Ruby</li>
    <li>Install Pry</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Terminal and CLI</h3>
      <p>Enjoyed learning this, also Googled some addition commands for moving multiple files at once and for creating folders with spaces in the name.</p>
    <ul><li>No (or reduced) fear of the command line</li>
        <li>An understanding that the command line allows direct access to a computer's underlying code</li>
        <li>Use of these three commands: ls, pwd, and cd</li>
        <li>Creating, moving and copying files</li>
        <li>Creating and removing directories</li>
        <li>Using the manual command</li>
        <li>Super user</li></ul>
    
    <h3>Git</h3>
    <p>My third attempt at this and I'm now starting to really get my head around it. Previous experience is helping though.</p>
    <ul><li>Recognise common git commands, such as fetch, init, clone, pull, push, add, remote, and commit</li>
        <li>Explain the following terms: 'staging', 'upstream', 'remote'</li>
        <li>Clone a git repo</li>
        <li>Add files for staging in a git repo</li>
        <li>Commit staged files in a git repo</li>
        <li>Push files to a remote repo</l
        <li>Fork a git repo</li>
    <li>Recall that git is a version control system (VCS)</li>

<h3>Ruby</h3>
    <p>Made a good start with Ruby, completing the first two quizzes.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>

        <p>Made some good progress today diving into Ruby. I used arrays and methods to solve some of the tasks. These have not been introduced on the Makers course yet but I'm familiar enough with these concepts that I felt comfortable using them.</p>
            
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/JonClarke84/ruby-exercises">Ruby Exercises</a></h3>
                <p>I especially enjoyed creating the text adventure game. I added a reload game feature for when the player is killed or wins the game.</p>
            <ul><li>Dice</li>
            <li>Dice Game</li>
            <li>Different Objects, Different Purposes</li>
            <li>Float Calculator</li>
            <li>Hello World</li>
            <li>Print Only Odd</li>
            <li>Shout at Sam</li>
            <li>Text Adventure</li>
            <li>To Do String</li>

        <p>Delving further into Ruby today, covering advanced control flow, arrays and hashes. Sorting through hashes has been the most challenging thing so far. </p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Another good day, I finished off the Ruby introduction with hashes, methods and classes before starting on the extended exercises. I also spent some time exploring various methods for arrays and hashes such as .select and .include.</p>
