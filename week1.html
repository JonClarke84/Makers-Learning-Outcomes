    <h3>Final Notes</h3>
    <p>I had done some of this process on some personal projects in the weeks leading up to starting with Makers. However, I'd only interfaced with Git and GitHub through the desktop app and VS Code.
    
    I had also completed the introduction to Git pre-course material that was sent out by email.
    
    Using the CLI in this exercises has given me a much better understanding of the process - especially when creating files using the terminal.</p>
