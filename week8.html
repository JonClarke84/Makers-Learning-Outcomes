                  <h2>Here's your end of unit reflection</h2>

                  <p>Because: I had done a fair amount of Javascript before starting the course,
                    and felt that a lot of what I have done this week is retread ground I had done
                    before. I'd have like to be shown some more advanced things, perhaps with a
                    clearer JS course that ramps up faster.</p>

                  <p>I feel generally great, I'm loving the course so far so any criticism should
                    be taken in this context. I very much want to learn React as this is the tech
                    I'll be using on my placement. I don't feel like I've had the time to try it this week.</p>

        <h2>Regarding the unit's overall goals</h2>
        <div class="grid-item-content">
    <p> The direction from the course material wasn't as clear as in previous weeks,
      so it was harder to know where to start. I think it hasn't helped that we have
      had a four day week and so I feel like it's been a bit rushed to get properly
      stuck into a whole new language.</p>

        <h2>Regarding your personal objectives</h2>

        <p>I wanted to build fully functioning web apps with JS and I didn't quite get there.
          The pairing challenge was the Thermostat and I think I'd have liked to spend time on something more exciting.</p>
