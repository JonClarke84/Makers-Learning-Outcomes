          <p>Continued to work through the extended task on the Student Directory. Learned some good methods for arrays, such as .uniq and .uniq!.</p>

        <div class="grid-item-content">
    <p>We had a much longer Workshop today, introducing hashes. I also had a bit of a disrupted afternoon's work so didn't get as much done as I would normally like.</p>
    <p></p>However, I have finished all of the material on the introduction to Ruby course. I've started work on mastery quiz 11, after which I'll be done with the extended material. Feeling good so far.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>

        <p>Another workshop today, this time on methods. I felt fairly comfortable with this - having completed the methods modules on the Ruby course and having good recent experience with Javascript functions</p>
        <p>I had a good pairing session on the Fizzbuzz TDD extension task. This was a good introduction, looking forward to starting properly on testing next week.</p>
        <p>I'm just about finished with the master quizzes. I have all the questions from 11 working properly, but I had a nightmare getting the first question to pass the tests. I'd written it differently to
          how the tests were expecting the program to perform so I've had to go through several rewrites. Lesson learned - use the tests to
          guide development next time.</p>
          <p>I also took a bit of time on my break to make my friend the most garish birthday message I could come up with. This was a fun experiment in CSS animation.</p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>

        <p>Not too much to say about today. I rewrote the Blackjack mastery quiz question from scratch and got it working fairly quickly
          the second time around. I used some of the lessons learned from the Fizzbuzz TDD example - writing it one piece at a time instead of all
          at once.
        </p>
        <p>After finishing all the extension work I started working on Codewars Ruby challenges, reaching 7 kyu.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>A long session on Feedback was the focus for the morning, followed by retro and pairing in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Although this left little time for code, I managed to do a few more Codewars challenges and also picked up some
          React on <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/jonClarke2325313685">Codecademy</a>.
