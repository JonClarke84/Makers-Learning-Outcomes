                  <h2>Thoughts on databses</h2>

                  <p>I enjoyed getting to grips with databases. I'd worked with a large database in
                    one of my previous roles at Holiday Extras, so I felt pretty comfortable with
                    the concepts.</p>
                  <p>I'd not use SQL before and so learning to interact with a database was great
                    as it felt I was filling in a large gap in my knowledge.
                  </p>
