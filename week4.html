                  <h2>Monday</h2>

                  <p>Getting back into the swing of things today, and not my fastest day by any stretch. I had decided to stretch myself with the last challenge
                    on Phase Two, but in the end I abandonded it in favour of a simpler solution.</p>

                    <p>This was because I felt that I wasn't learning much and was just taking a lot of extra time to write unncessary functionality into the code.</p>

                    <p>After doing that and getting it working I moved on to the first mocking exercise, completing that before the end of the day. I used the last half hour to watch some tutorials on making videos with React.
                  </p>

    <p>Good progress today, and a good pairing session. I finished up the exercises and mocking bites to complete the bulk of the 
      material on the golden square.</p>
      <p>I finished the day by making a start on the solo project.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>

        <p>Empathy workshop in the morning meant less coding than previous days this week. However, I was able to get plenty done on the solo project in the afternoon,
          working alongside my pair.

        <h2>Thursday</h2>

        <p>Today was a day for working solo on the project. I got sidetracked a lot trying to write tests for the standard input.</p>
        <p>In the end I abandoned this approach and made good progress, finishing the day with the project mostly done - just one bug
          in the basket method.

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Good day today - finished the solo project, including Twilio integration. I had a solid pairing session in the afternoon,
          helping a peer with some exercises before we tackled the Bank Tech Test together.
